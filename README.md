# Introduction

Config files for Linux and WSL

# Installation

- Each folder either contain a folder for Linux or WSL or not. If there isn't any subfolder, both Linux and WSL use the same configuration.

- Each folder has a `install` file that contains the location of the configuration file. 

- To install the configuration, run `install.[sh/fish] <Platform you are running>`. Eg: `./install.fish WSL`
